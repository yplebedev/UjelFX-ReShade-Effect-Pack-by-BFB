Really, really specific shaders for reshade. Not much beyond that.

Ujel "HDR" - a shader that does quite a few things i personally commonly do all at the same time; but in HDR space. Bloom blooms more bloomily, and the tonemapper behaves a bit more sensibly. This effect is only somewhat-a joke effect, it has way too many settings.

Ujel Saturation - a shader that lets you boost saturation without it looking to fugly, based on oklab. loosely based on Dan Margulis' advice. Use the saturation slider to deepfry your image slightly, and tone it down with a lerp.
