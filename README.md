Really, really specific shaders for reshade. Not much beyond that.

TIP: if you're playing on a source engine game, check the bin folder for dxvk. If one is present, run the installer for VK, and make sure you add -vulkan to launch params. 

Ujel "HDR" - a shader that does quite a few things i personally commonly do all at the same time; but in HDR space. Bloom blooms more bloomily, and the tonemapper behaves a bit more sensibly. To use the toe, shoulder, black clip and white clip enable Unreal Engine 4 mode.
Otherwise, using the default fit is recomended.

Ujel Saturation - a shader that lets you boost saturation without it looking to fugly, based on oklab. loosely based on Dan Margulis' advice. Use the saturation slider to deepfry your image slightly, and tone it down with a lerp.
